# how long to wait before starting the entire simulation
# REASON: gazebo needs time spawn all objects
sim-start-delay: 1.5

# how long to wait after simulation start and before first movement
# REASON: the simulated liquid needs to settle
move-start-delay: 1.0

# for how many simulation iterations shall we wait before finishing each motion phase
# REASON: after finishing a motion, we might have to wait for an effect to happen, i.e. liquid falling
