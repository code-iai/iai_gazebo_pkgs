# how long to wait before starting the entire simulation
# REASON: gazebo needs time spawn all objects
sim-start-delay: 1.0 # in s

# how long to wait after simulation start and before first movement
# REASON: the simulated liquid needs to settle
move-start-delay: 1.0 # in s

# how long to wait after simulation start and before start of logging
# REASON: with a lot of simulated liquid it might cause collision events
#         when settling; these events could corrupt the logs
log-delay: 2.0 # in s

# name of object model controlled by controller
controlled-model: Cup

# name of addtional object model observed by controller
observed-model: PancakeMaker

# for how many simulation iterations shall we wait before finishing each motion phase
# REASON: after finishing a motion, we might have to wait for an effect to happen, i.e. liquid falling
